Description: Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are
  using disk space without requiring sort or head. Dust will print a
  maximum of 1 'Did not have permissions message'. Dust will list the 20 biggest
  sub directories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the
  larger ones. There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag. The largest sub
  directory will have its size shown in red
